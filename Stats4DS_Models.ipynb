Using panel data from 2010 to 2019, we employ random effects models to analyze the relationships. The results show that technical and risk metrics are highly effective in explaining Price, but have limited explanatory power for Debt-to-Equity, Profit Margin, and ROE. The findings suggest that risk metrics, such as Beta and Volatility, are key drivers of Price, while other factors may be more important for explaining Debt-to-Equity, Profit Margin, and ROE.**"
